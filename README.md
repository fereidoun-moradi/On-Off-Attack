# On-Off-Attack

Here, we present Rebeca code that is based on actors. It consists of actors: Miner, MalMiner, User and MalUser. The actor User generates transactions continuously and transmits them to the miner to process these transactions and store in the distributed ledger. The actor MalUser works with MalMiner who is in charge of doing injection on the ledger. This dishonest miner stores the fake transactions in a pending pool and ready to append transactions one by one while building a new block. The distributed ledger is defined by a n * 8 list. n is current number of built blocks and eight specifies [minerID, BlockID, utx1,$ $tx1, utx2, tx2, utx3, tx3] which are miner, block and transactions identity numbers. Therefore, we easily can find out which transactions are stored in the distributed ledger and show the infected spot where the fake transactions injected.
